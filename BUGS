* File -> Disconnect Program sometimes stalls out when listening for an
  empty response.  (The process dies and the stream is closed?)


* Connect program then disconnect, then reconnect, terminal is quiet.
  #### This occurs if the debugging code in the method 'cmdConnectLocalProg'
  is uncommented -- this code copies the procedures error stream to stdout. 
  Something bad seems to happen when the process is killed and this
  StreamCopy is still active...?
